# Distill4Geo: Efficient Cross-View Geo-Localization with Lightweight Models

Welcome to the official repository of **Distill4Geo**, a novel knowledge distillation framework designed for cross-view geo-localization. This repository accompanies the paper *Distill4Geo: Streamlined Knowledge Transfer from Contrastive Weight-Sharing Teachers to Independent, Lightweight View Experts*, **currently under review at CVPR 2025**.

## üìñ Overview

Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) aims to match images from different perspectives‚Äîlike satellite and street views‚Äîto the same geographic location. Distill4Geo addresses the computational overhead and inefficiencies in traditional contrastive methods by proposing:

- **Lightweight, non-weight-sharing student models** for independent view representation.
- **Dual Cosine Embedding Loss** for efficient knowledge transfer from a contrastive-trained teacher model.
- **Data Augmentation with Marginal Perturbations** to improve pair-wise generalization.

Our approach achieves **state-of-the-art performance** with significant reductions in parameters (3√ó) and GFLOPs (13.5√ó) compared to existing models.

## üöÄ Features

- **Efficient Knowledge Transfer**: A teacher-student framework eliminates the need for large batch sizes and hard-negative mining.
- **Dual Distillation**: Uses cosine embedding loss to bring each student closer to the teacher's representations.
- **Lightweight Students**: FasterViT-based architecture for resource-efficient training and inference.
- **Generalization Across Datasets**: Achieves competitive results on CVUSA, CVACT, and VIGOR datasets.

## üèÜ Highlights

- **Parameters**: Reduced 3√ó compared to the teacher model.
- **GFLOPs**: Over 13.5√ó lower computational cost.
- **Performance**: Competitive accuracy across datasets.
- **Scalability**: Independent student training enables resource-efficient deployment.
